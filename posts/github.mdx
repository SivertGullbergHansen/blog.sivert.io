## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six <KBD>#</KBD> symbols before your heading text. The number of <KBD>#</KBD> you use will determine the size of the heading.

```markdown
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and `.md` files.

| Style | Syntax | Keyboard shortcut | Example | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bold | `** **` or `__ __` | <KBD>Command</KBD>+<KBD>B</KBD> (Mac) or <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>B</KBD> (Windows/Linux) | `**This is bold text**` | **This is bold text** |
| Italic | `* *` or `_ _` | <KBD>Command</KBD>+<KBD>I</KBD> (Mac) or <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>I</KBD> (Windows/Linux) | `*This text is italicized*` | *This text is italicized* |
| Strikethrough | `~~ ~~` | | `~~This was mistaken text~~` | ~~This was mistaken text~~ |
| Bold and nested italic | `** **` and `_ _` | | `**This text is _extremely_ important**` | **This text is _extremely_ important** |
| All bold and italic | `*** ***` | | `***All this text is important***` | ***All this text is important*** |
| Subscript | `<sub> </sub>` | | `<sub>This is a subscript text</sub>` | <sub>This is a subscript text</sub> |
| Superscript | `<sup> </sup>` | | `<sup>This is a superscript text</sup>` | <sup>This is a superscript text</sup> |

## Quoting text

You can quote text with a <KBD>></KBD>.

```markdown
Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
```

## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the <KBD>Command</KBD>+<KBD>E</KBD> (Mac) or <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>E</KBD> (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

## Supported color models

In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

```markdown
The background color should be `#ffffff` for light mode and `#0d1117` for dark mode.
```

Here are the currently supported color models.

| Color | Syntax | Example | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`. You can also use the keyboard shortcut <KBD>Command</KBD>+<KBD>K</KBD> to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Images

You can display an image by adding <KBD>!</KBD> and wrapping the alt text in `[ ]`. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses `()`.

`![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)`

Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.

| Context | Relative Link |
| ------ | -------- |
| In a `.md` file on the same branch | `/assets/images/electrocat.png` |
| In a `.md` file on another branch | `/../main/assets/images/electrocat.png` |
| In issues, pull requests and comments of the repository | `../blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true` |
| In a `.md` file in another repository | `/../../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png` |
| In issues, pull requests and comments of another repository | `../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true` |

For more information, see "[Relative Links](#relative-links)."

### Specifying the theme an image is shown to

You can specify the theme an image is displayed for in Markdown by using the HTML `<picture>` element in combination with the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature. We distinguish between light and dark color modes, so there are two options available. You can use these options to display images optimized for dark or light backgrounds. This is particularly helpful for transparent PNG images.

For example, the following code displays a sun image for light themes and a moon for dark themes:

The old method of specifying images based on the theme, by using a fragment appended to the URL (`#gh-dark-mode-only` or `#gh-light-mode-only`), is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the new method described above.

## Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with <KBD>-</KBD>, <KBD>*</KBD>, or <KBD>+</KBD>.

```markdown
- George Washington
* John Adams
+ Thomas Jefferson
```

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

```markdown
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
```

### Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

```markdown
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item `100. First list item` by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (`100. `) before `First list item`.

```markdown
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
```

You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (`␣␣␣␣␣-␣`) before the nested list content `First nested list item`, you would need to indent the second nested list item by seven spaces.

```markdown
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item
```

For more examples, see the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-265).

## Task lists

If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with <KBD>\\</KBD>:

`- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue`

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)."

## Mentioning people and teams

`@github/support What do you think about these updates?`

When you mention a parent team, members of its child teams also receive notifications, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)."

Typing an <KBD>@</KBD> symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and press either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the conversation.

The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.

## Referencing issues and pull requests

You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing <KBD>#</KBD>. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls)."

## Uploading assets

You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and `.md` files in your repository.

## Using emoji

You can add emoji to your writing by typing `:EMOJICODE:`.

`@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:`

Typing <KBD>:</KBD> will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press **Tab** or **Enter** to complete the highlighted result.

For a full list of available emoji and codes, check out [the Emoji-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).

## Paragraphs

You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

## Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

```markdown
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
```
