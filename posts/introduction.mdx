## Hello, and welcome to my blog! :wave:

I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you, and I thought I'd start by giving you a little introduction to who I am.

### My name is Sivert

and I'm the creator of this blog. I've been a coding enthusiast since around the age of 13 and have over 7 years of experience in programming. I'm currently working as a Front-End developer, and in my free time, I love doing indie-game development, working on open-source projects and listening to music. I'm passionate about coding, knowledge-sharing and meeting new people, and I can't stand ananas on pizza, crowded places and an empty stomach.

### When I'm not working

you can usually find me watching some serie/anime, or looking for my next Raspberry Pi project. One of my favorite things to do is **learning by doing**. I also love watching movies/series/anime, which I find super calming. Watching movies and series help fuel my passion for game development.

### In terms of my professional experience

I've published a research paper ([Link](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7555-2983)), been the first bachelor student of my university to publish such a paper, and been invited to speak at the Human Computer Interaction International conference of 2023. I've published 1 paper on The Awareness and Practices of Web Developers toward Sustainable Web Design, and my work has been recognized by HCII and NTNU. I'm passionate about sustainable web development, and I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to innovate and make an impact.

Overall, I'm excited to share my journey with you through this blog, and I hope you find my posts informative and entertaining. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to comment down below or [contact me through Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sivertgullberghansen/).
