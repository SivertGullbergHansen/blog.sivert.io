Hi, I'm Sivert Gullberg Hansen, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my blog!

### Education

Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Interaction Design at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Gj√∏vik. My journey in academia began with a bachelor's degree in Web Development, where I specialized in Sustainable Web Design. Our dedication to sustainability led to the honor of receiving the prestigious Eurekaprize for our outstanding bachelor project.

### Professional Endeavors

As a Full-Stack Developer, I have a passion for creating sustainable web solutions that align with environmental values. In fact, my dedication to sustainable web design has resulted in the publication of two scientific papers on the subject. You can find these papers by searching for my name on Google Scholar or visiting my ORCID profile (ORCID: 0000-0001-7555-2983). These papers delve into the latest research and advancements in sustainable web design practices.

Professionally, I currently serve as a Front-end Developer at Norsk Tipping. In this role, I leverage my expertise in web development to craft intuitive and engaging user experiences.

### Personal Ventures

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am actively engaged in open-source projects. I'm particularly excited about Gryt, an open-source alternative to Discord that I'm currently developing. Gryt provides a platform for seamless communication and collaboration. You can check it out at [Gryt.Chat](https://gryt.chat).

### Beyond Work

Aside from my work, I enjoy delving into indie game development, where I apply my skills in networking, object-oriented programming, and modeling/texture design. It's a creative outlet that allows me to explore new horizons.

I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to exciting projects in the web development realm. Don't hesitate to reach out, and let's discuss how we can create a more sustainable and innovative digital future together!

Feel free to explore my GitHub profile, where you can find a variety of intriguing projects in NodeJS, as well as projects showcasing my proficiency in languages like HTML, Tailwind, and TypeScript.
